## Linux Commands

### man
It displays the manual page of any other command (as long as it has one).

### pwd
Use the pwd command to find out the path of the current working directory (folder) you’re in.

### cd
To navigate through the Linux files and directories, use the cd command.

### ls
The ls command is used to view the contents of a directory. By default, this command will display the contents of your current working directory.

### cat
It is used to list the contents of a file on the standard output (sdout). To run this command, type cat followed by the file’s name and its extension.

### cp
Use the cp command to copy files from the current directory to a different directory.

### mv
The primary use of the mv command is to move files, although it can also be used to rename files.

### rm
Used to remove files and directories. 

### alias
The alias command lets you define temporary aliases in your shell session. When creating an alias, you instruct your shell to replace a word with a series of commands.

### mkdir
Used to create folders in the shell.

### exit
With it, you can end a shell session and, in most cases, automatically close the terminal you’re using.
