## Linux Commands

### pwd
Use the pwd command to find out the path of the current working directory (folder) you’re in.

### cd

### ls
The ls command is used to view the contents of a directory. By default, this command will display the contents of your current working directory.

### cat
It is used to list the contents of a file on the standard output (sdout). To run this command, type cat followed by the file’s name and its extension.

### cp
Use the cp command to copy files from the current directory to a different directory.

### mv
The primary use of the mv command is to move files, although it can also be used to rename files.
